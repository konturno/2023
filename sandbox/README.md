Title: 2022-12-25 ~ Draw Helix Segments

The underlying geometry is a helix (3D spiral) wrapped around a torus (doughnut) with a vertical exaggeration.

25 lines comprising 600 tiny segments with width are created that use the helix as a path. The lines  are spaced apart at just the right distance so that the start and end points have exactly the same height. The positions of the lines are updated 60 times a second.

The effect is quite pleasing as it is. It's going to to be interesting to see if I can improve it in any way.

BTW, the video is still not a "perfect loop". There is a jump when the video restarts at the beginning. I'm still working om this.

The script is plain and simple JavaScript calling the Three.js library hosted at https://Threes.org

Title: 2022-12-23 ~ Draw Helix Segments

The underlying geometry is a helix (3D spiral) wrapped around a torus (doughnut) with a vertical exaggeration.

A number of lines are created that use the helix as a path. They are spaced apart at just the right distance so that the start and end points have exactly the same height.

The effect is quite nice and relaxing, but the effect is not yet as "interesting" as the inspiration: https://optikstudies.com/case_studies?series=0048

In terms of capturing a video from the running program, you want to capture a "perfect loop" where the last frame and the first frame are close enough so that when automatic replay is on there is no screen jerking and you feel that the progression is continuous. The current video is nearly there (but not quite).

Updated the CCapture script and added it here to allow the slithering script to record and save a video. Recorded the first video and saved it to WEBM and MP4.

Title: 2022-12-20 ~ Draw Lines Slithering

At long last, I'm back at the digital drawing board.

The idea is to draw any number of parallel lines "slithering" around a sphere (or ultimately any object) in a pleasing manner. The lines can be any length and the tails slowly fade out as the front tip moves forward.

Further iterations may include

1. Improved control over the paths taken by the lines
2. Making a perfect loop so that there is no visual jump between the last frame and the first frame when videos replay automatically

First a number of lines are drawn. Every screen refresh, the lines are replaced a new set of lines with new coordinates

Fading is handles by an array of RGB shades applied to a material with colors by vertex.

Fading and updating of the vertices is going OK, but there is still much thought needed to be given to displacing the vertices in an elegant a manner as Wang Yen Chi is doing. Part of the issue may be because of thinking in latitude and longitude. I will return to phi and theta in the next update.

Also I need to figure out how to avoid going over the poles,

Every 500 ms iteration a new line is added and the oldest line is removed.

Every animation frame, the opacity of one of the lines is reduced - eventually making the lin invisible

A sort of heartbeat feeling is achieved, complex moire effects. Work-in-progress
